Never accidentally edit your live site again!  

This super simple WordPress plugin hides your WordPress site from people who aren't logged in, displays a simple message for people who aren't logged in (see screengrab), adds a bright red favicon and changes the color of the WP admin bar to bright red to help you know you are editing a DEV site.
