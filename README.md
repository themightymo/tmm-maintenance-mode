Never accidentally edit your live site again!  

This super simple WordPress plugin hides your WordPress site from people who aren't logged in, displays a simple message for people who aren't logged in (see screengrab), adds a bright red favicon and changes the color of the WP admin bar to bright red to help you know you are editing a DEV site.

![Frontend default view for people who aren't logged in](https://github.com/themightymo/tmm-maintenance-mode/blob/master/screenshot-2.png?raw=true)


Additionally, you can add an image using the WP media uploader and replace the default message with whatever you'd like, including html markup:


![Admin view with html markup](https://github.com/themightymo/tmm-maintenance-mode/blob/master/admin-view-with-markup.png?raw=true)


![Frontend view with html markup](https://github.com/themightymo/tmm-maintenance-mode/blob/master/public-view-with-markup.png?raw=true)

All logged-in users will see the site without a "Maintenance Mode" message, only the admin bar and favicon will be red.
